During my virtual internship at JPMorgan Chase, I collaborated closely with traders specializing in equities. They required new functionality on their dashboard to monitor a recently developed trading strategy. To achieve this, I established a robust system capable of interfacing with pertinent financial data feeds. This allowed me to perform necessary computations and present the output in a manner that enables real-time visualization and analysis by traders.

Throughout the project, I utilized JPMorgan Chase's proprietary open-source software, Perspective, to implement the required changes effectively. This involved translating user requirements into actionable features, ensuring that the final product aligned seamlessly with the traders' needs. By doing so, I not only gained practical experience in financial data analysis and visualization but also demonstrated my ability to deliver solutions that enhance operational efficiency and decision-making within a trading environment.

The visualization of charts and data analysis our trader’s see is all built on JPMorgan Chase's own open sourced software called Perspective. i learned how to implement this to facilitate the trader’s requested changes and deliver actionable insights.

i  gained an understanding of the user requirements and then build something that meets those requirements
